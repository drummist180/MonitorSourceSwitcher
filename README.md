Monitor Source Switcher
=======

Cycles between monitor sources using a global hotkey (double scroll lock) or task tray item.
This is useful if you have more than one device connected to your monitor(s) and you would
like the ability to rapidly change which source is active.

Available monitors and sources are automatically detected.
Sources can be added/removed from the set of cycled sources using checkboxes in the menu.
